Average acceleration in first 100 seconds:

(70.618 - 56.046) / 10 = 1.46 m/s**2

So working back:

56.046 / ((70.618 - 56.046) / 10) = 38.46 seconds.

Mean speed = 56.046 / 2 = 28.023

Means speed * 38.46 seconds = 
(56.046 / 2) * 56.046 / ((70.618 - 56.046) / 10) = 1077.8 m

Hmm OpenStreetMap download as SVG is just a a SVG wrapper around a (high resolution) PNG with a data URI.
